Game of Thrones Trivia is an application that uses jQuery to allow the user to view and answer 10 trivia questions (in this case the topic is Game of Thrones).

### How It Works
* Initially, the user will arrive at the landing page where they can click "Start Quiz" to begin the trivia game.
* The user will have 30 seconds to answer each question and they will be prompted as to whether or not they chose correctly.
* At the end of the game, the user will be given a summary of their results and have the option to play again.
